# weekly-md-calendar

Creates a markdown file for each week of the year using ISO week numbering, for example: "2023-W01".

- The files include headings for every day of the week.
- I use this to generate a weekly diary I use in Obsidian.
- Does 52/53 week years correctly (probably).

Example:

```md
---
timestamp: 2023-05-15T00:00:00+01:00
week: 2023-W20
---
<[[2023-W19]] | [[2023-W21]] >
